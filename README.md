# Koibanx Challenge

This is a technical challenge to prove my frontend expertise.

## Getting started

First, install the project dependencies

`npm install`

Then just start the app

`npm start`

And you're ready to go!

## How it was created?

This app was developed with React, Typescript and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started). It was initialized with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

Throught the codebase you'll see components made with Chakra's styled system. Layouts, inputs and even the table was made granularly with this technic.

To carry out the task of updating and filtering I used React's context API.

To interact with the system without the hassle of downloading you can visit it's website!

## Deployment

This challenge is deployed in AWS using [Amplify's hosting service](https://aws.amazon.com/es/amplify/hosting/).
